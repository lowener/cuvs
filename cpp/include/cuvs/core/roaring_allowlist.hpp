 * @brief Owning immutable exact Roaring allowlist over CAGRA dataset-row IDs.

 * Build an allowlist through @ref from_ids, then pass its zero-copy @ref view to a
 * cuvs::neighbors::filtering::roaring_bitmap_filter. A filter maps one such view to each query;
 * owners remain independent and can therefore be reused across filters and queries.
 *
 * Construction sorts IDs on the GPU unless @p pre_sorted is true. Setting @p pre_sorted promises
 * that IDs are already in strictly increasing order; this promise is not verified. IDs must be
 * unique and smaller than @p dataset_rows. The encoded bytes and the initialized
 * cuco::experimental::roaring_bitmap_ref<uint32_t> are retained on the device. Creating a view
 * never copies or reparses them, and CAGRA search performs no Roaring initialization.
 *
 * ID-based construction emits the standard portable 32-bit Roaring array and bitmap container
 * forms. Each ID is partitioned by its high 16 bits; the low 16 bits are stored as an array for at
 * most 4,096 values in a partition and as an 8 KiB bitmap otherwise.
