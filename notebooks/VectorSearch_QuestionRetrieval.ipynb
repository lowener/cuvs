    "\n",
    "This notebook is inspired by the [similar search example of Sentence-Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/semantic-search/README.html#similar-questions-retrieval), and adapted to support [cuVS ANN](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuvs) algorithm.\n",

    "The model was pre-trained on the [Natural Questions dataset](https://ai.google.com/research/NaturalQuestions). It consists of about 100k real Google search queries, together with an annotated passage from Wikipedia that provides the answer. It is an example of an asymmetric search task. As corpus, we use the smaller [Simple English Wikipedia](http://sbert.net/datasets/simplewiki-2020-11-01.jsonl.gz) so that it fits easily into memory.\n",

Tides cause changes in the depth of marine and estuarine (river mouth) waters. Tides also make oscillating currents known as tidal streams (~'rip tides'). This means that being able to predict the tide is important for coastal navigation. The strip of seashore that is under water at high tide and exposed at low tide, called the intertidal zone, is an important ecological product of ocean tides.\"]\n",

A strong blow over the ocean causes larger waves as the moving air pushes against the raised ridges of water. The waves reach their greatest height when the rate at which they travel nearly matches the speed of the wind. The waves form at right angles to the direction from which the wind blows. In open water, if the wind continues to blow, as happens in the Roaring Forties in the southern hemisphere, long, organized masses of water called swell roll across the ocean. If the wind dies down, the wave formation is reduced but waves already formed continue to travel in their original direction until they meet land. Small waves form in small areas of water with islands and other landmasses but large waves form in open stretches of sea where the wind blows steadily and strongly. When waves meet other waves coming from different directions, interference between the two can produce broken, irregular seas.']\n",
